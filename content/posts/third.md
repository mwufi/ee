From a site on the internet:

> **Given all the films that came before in this genre, how did you avoid all the usual tropes?**

> Phil and Matt had a couple of ideas that animated how I approached the filmmaking: Erin Bell suffers not because she’s amoral, but because she’s moral. There was this idea that we’re watching an investigation where we come to understand that the detective is hunting herself. In thinking about those two ideas, it creates a necessity for a different kind of emphasis on her obsession, her stubbornness, her strength, her will, and that obsessive drive that starts to taint her character. Eventually we realize the non-linear part of the storytelling will inform the peculiarity of her character. I kept trying to lean into specific visual gestures that felt really interesting. For instance, seeing her uncomfortably close—you want to look away, but when it’s somebody like Nicole who occupies the role so fully, you can’t look away from her.
